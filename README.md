# Scripts Repository

Welcome to my experimental scripting repository! This is a collection of various automation scripts and utilities I've developed to streamline different workflows and tasks.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository contains experimental scripts for various purposes, from gaming automation to general utilities. Each script or collection comes with its own documentation and usage instructions.

## 📁 Current Projects

### iRacing Scripts
**Location:** [IRacingScripts/](IRacingScripts/)  
**Description:** Automation scripts for iRacing sim racing setup  
**Documentation:** [IRacingScripts/README.md](IRacingScripts/README.md)

A PowerShell script that automatically launches all essential iRacing applications (MOZA Pit House, CrewChief V4, Trading Paints, irDashies, and iRacing UI) in one go, saving time and ensuring you don't forget any critical tools before racing sessions.

## 🧪 Experimental Nature

**Please note:** These scripts are experimental and created for personal use. While they work for my specific setup and requirements, they may need modification for your environment. Always review scripts before running them on your system.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts are provided as-is without warranty. Please review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them on production systems.
